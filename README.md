# Cognits outsource webpage

1. Must be EXACTLY as the [design](/DESIGN.png) in the repository.
2. The Cognits website MUST use: [skrollr.js](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr) for the parallax.
3. Use the colors in the cognits_colorpallete.pdf
4. Be responsive, using Twitter Bootstrap.


To run the code, you will need to download [Google App Engine for Python/Linux](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads).
## Requirements
- Implement ONE section at a time, after completing each section, do a PULL-REQUEST! (a section is like intro, quotes...)
- Write code using best practices
- Skrollr should work without writting Javascript, just using the HTML element attributes!!! IMPORTANT
- Must look good in Phone and Desktop.


If you have questions about design, write to Julio in Slack. Or if you have questions about development, write to Sebas.

## After
After completing the above tasks, and implementing the whole design, NOT BEFORE, do the following:
- Optimize the website. (Minify, add **async** to JS scripts, optimize images...)
- Automate the workflow using Gulp (this may require to change the project structure)
- Build tests with Jasmine
